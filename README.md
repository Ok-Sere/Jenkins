# Jenkins

## Introduction

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are essential practices in modern software development. CI/CD automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying applications, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery. Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server that enables developers to implement CI/CD pipelines efficiently. With Jenkins, teams can automate building, testing, and deploying their applications, improving productivity and reducing manual errors.
